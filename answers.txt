1. The TWI describes the tendency of an area to accumulate water. 
TWÃŒ= ln (SCA/ tan slope)
2. Where the Specific Catchment Area describes the tendency to receive water and the slope angle and draining contour length describes the tendency to evacuate water. Assuming steady-stat conditions throughout the soil.


FOSS GIS Tools to calculate TWI

1. GRASS GIS
1. r.topidx 
2. r.watershed 
3. r.terraflow

2. QGIS Processing Toolbox
SAGA/ Terrain Analysis - Hydology/ Topographic wetness index (One Step)
Sink Removal/ Slope, Aspect, Curvature/ Flow Accumulation/ Flow Width and Specific Catchment Area/ Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)(Step-by-Step)


3. R
atb: raster Optional raster used as criteria for locating the channel. Typically the
value of the topographic wetness index (TWI) determined from the elevations.
Should be in a projected coordinate system (e.g UTM) and use a regular grid
spacing.
For the TWI to be meaningful this raster should have a resolution of a least
30m. It can be calculated using the upslope.area method applied to the DEM
and atb=TRUE.
